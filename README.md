Proteins expressed on the extracellular region and their interacting partmners critically regulate cellular communication during homeostasis and diseases as as such represents main therapeutic targets. Now we wish to build the interactome network  of these proteins and try to simulate them with different parameters.
EXCESP is a Structure-based Online Database for Extracellular Interactome of Cell Surface Proteins in Human, that covers a large portion of cell surface proteins and the interactions between their ectodomains in human. Predicted interactions in the database are determined using a combines structural, functional, evolutionary and expression information. Currently, EXECSP contains 13877 PPIs for extracellular cell surface interactome of the human proteome. The database utilized computational modeling tools to generate interactome of cell surface proteins and structural models of associated interactions in the network. Comparing with time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental techniques, computational approaches offers possess of unique advantage in detecting protein-protein interactions and modeling structure of protein complexes
